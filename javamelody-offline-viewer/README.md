# View reports on data offline without access to online reports

* If ever you don't have access to the online reports of javamelody on the running server,
* or if you want to view the reports of aggregated data for several instances of an application and you don't use the optional [collect server](../../../wiki/UserGuideAdvanced#optional-centralization-server-setup) and separated reports are not enough,
* or if you want to view the reports but the server is no longer running,
* or if you want some pdf reports and you have not included the [iText dependency](../../../wiki/UserGuide#dependencies),
* then the offline viewer may be for you, in a degraded mode compared to online reports.

See [doc](../../../wiki/UserGuideAdvanced#offline-viewer)
